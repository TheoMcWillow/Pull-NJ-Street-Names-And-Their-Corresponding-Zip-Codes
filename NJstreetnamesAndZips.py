# Clicking on a county will bring you to a page that has all the municipalities located within that county
# Clicking on a municipality will bring you to a page that lists all street names and corresponding zip codes in that municipality
# Zip codes in NJ all start with the number zero, but this site is not showing that leading zero
# Nonetheless I was able to add a zero onto the beginning of the zip codes, as you will see below


# all in all, this code goes through each municipality in each NJ county and grabs all the street names and corresponding zip codes
# the hard part is storing these in a data structure

#### So basically I was able to go though each municipality in each county and grab the Street names & zip codes
#### my problem now is figuring out how to store these street names
